# The Rudiments of Musical Notation

This repository will contain a digitization project of a book from 1900 (therefore public domain) by William D. Armstrong (1868--1936). 

It will be implemented by using solely open source software for OCR and musical notation.

The source for the digitization can be found on archive.org:
